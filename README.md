For this project a database about medical parameters of patients was chosen. The key column in this dataset was ALF (for __Acute Liver Failure__). 

The __workflow__ was:
__1__ Data cleaning
__2__ Finding top correlating variables with ALF
__3__ Performing statistical test to the top 3 variables to demonstrate that there were differences in the values of each of these variables between patients who suffered acute liver failure and patients who did not.
__4__ Obtaining Principal Components to reduce the number of variables to define ALF.
__5__ Performing logistic regression to predict ALF or not on hypothetical new patients data.
